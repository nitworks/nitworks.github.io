## A More Familiar Example

Suppose you are using Microsoft Excel to analyse large amounts of data and produce reports for your business executives. Randomly one day, Excel hangs and you have to restart. This continues to happen more and more frequently, destroying your productivity. It's not clear what is causing it, so you raise it to your tech team for help.

After a couple of days they come back with a grand plan to migrate you to a "cloud-based, managed, big-data warehouse with a web front-end". This will take a month or two and in the meantime you have to just keep restarting Excel.

I'm sorry to inform you - your engineering team lost the plot and started bikeshedding. It is much more fun and exciting to think about using new sparkly technologies than to solve an obscure Excel issue. However, it does not actually help restore your productivity.

I'm not picking on Excel here. I think it is probably the best piece of software ever created on many counts. I'm using it as an example precisely because of its popularity and ubiquity.

This happens most often when working with legacy internal systems. These are typically often old, clunky, difficult to change and a nightmare to test but still mission critical to the business. You are probably familiar with them if you work in late-adopter industries such as finance, health and energy.

Bikeshedding is rife in software engineering, especially when technology is not the main business. There is a fine balance between engineering high-quality software that is **fit for purpose** and over-engineering a solution because it is the right thing to do from a purely technology perspective (or just more fun).
