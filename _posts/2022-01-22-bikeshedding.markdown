## The Scenario
Imagine you are in a one-hour board meeting discussing the launch of a new nuclear power station. The chief scientist begins with a presentation on the high-level safety procedures and precautions; waste management, evacuation protocols and all those highly critical components that mean success or failure - and life or death. 

Important stuff, but can be a bit of a snoozefest. The scientist knows this and keeps it succinct - she finishes her presentation in 13 minutes. In the Q&A that follows, only a couple of people ask some relatively basic sanity-checking queries. The scientist reassures them and scans the room waiting for other questions. After just the right amount of awkward silence, she yields with 45 minutes left in the meeting.

Next up is the facilities manager. The plant wants to market itself as climate-friendly so he proposes building a world-class bike shed to encourage employees to cycle to work. The room starts buzzing as people discuss the design of the bike shed - layout, security, aesthetics and anything else that comes to mind. The meeting runs to the end of the hour, with follow-ups added to the agenda for the next meeting. The board members stand and leave, satisfied with the meeting and their contribution.

## So what's the problem?

The problem is that the board spent 75% of the time and the majority of the energy and attention on the bike shed - a nice to have - rather than the safey precautions that could save lives and the business.

This demonstrates the **Law of Triviality**, aka Bikeshedding:

> Time and energy are disproportionately allocated towards relatively trivial matters at the expense of more important issues.

Think about it - does this happen in your workplace?

## Why does this happen?

Important topics tend to be complex:
- More factors to consider and trade-off
- Require technical or subject-matter expertise
- May take hours or days of thinking, planning and designing alone or in small groups
- Higher cognitive overhead - tiring to think about
- Often tedious and unsexy

All of these things mean that there are simply fewer people who can be part of a helpful and constructive conversation. The average Joe probably doesn't even want to know the details, just the headline. 

In the above scenario, the chief scientist is the only one equipped to make decisions on safety in a power plant and is merely informing the other board members. So the majority of board members keep their mouths shut and trust the expert, ending the conversation quickly.

However, the bike shed is an idea with which everyone is familiar and can contribute. **People want to contribute, and have their voices heard**. It makes them feel like they are providing value and reduce feelings of imposter syndrome (which everyone experiences). The facilities manager may have some logistical or architectural expertise, but the topic is approachable and fun enough for the layman to share an opinion. 

## Is this really a problem?

Yes. Translate it into monetary terms - imagine 10 board members earn $500,000 each a year and there are 2,500 working hours in a year. That means the time-value of the whole meeting was $2000, of which $1500 went towards discussing the bike shed and only $500 towards the safety of the powerplant.

Now think about the cost implication of a design flaw in the bike shed versus any one of the safety precautions. It would seem insane that the latter got 1/3 of the investment.

You might argue that the safety matter was "resolved", i.e. required no further discussion and therefore it made sense to move on to less important topics. That may be true, but it should be assumed that people have better things to do than to be kept in a room discussing the colours of a bike shed. Surely it's better to give busy people 45 minutes back in their day, right?

The even more insidious issue is that trivial conversations can go on endlessly, with people getting ever more opinionated. This shifts the focus entirely away from the more important matters and becomes an endless time suck because nothing gets decided as there is no longer an authority that can make a final decision. As the saying goes, too many chefs in the kitchen spoil the broth.

## How to avoid Bikeshedding

Each case will be different, but there are a few things you can do to detect and reduce Bikeshedding in your team and organisation.

- **Prioritise often and mercilessly.** This laser-focus on what is most important will reduce the frequency and length of tangential discussions during periods of high productivity - what I call *Game Time*.

- **Dedicate time for tangential discussions in a relaxed environment**, perhaps over a drink outside of the office on a Friday afternoon. This *Play Time* can often stoke creative ideas that are incredibly valuable to future endeavours. When these conversations come up during *Game Time*, they are easier to park knowing that they can be resumed  during *Play Time*.

- **Empower individuals or small groups with full authority** over a particular project. This reduces the number of opinions, and therefore distractions, early in the project. Invite opinions and feedback regularly on specific aspects where the authority needs more input to make a decision. In this way, explicit  ownership over projects alone can hugely improve quality and delivery without diminishing the positive effects of teamwork.

- **Keep meeting agendas tight**. Each item should have an expected amount of time to limit the effects of Parkinson's law. 
Ensure the moderator has the authority to keep conversations on topic by cutting diversions short and penciling them down for another meeting. At the end of the agenda, give people time back in their day - they will love you for it.
