There seems a common belief that bringing more people into a conversation will lead to a better result. This is only applicable within constraints, e.g. whether those people have particular knowledge and experience that is relevant to the problem at hand. 

If you ask random people to discuss a complex topic, the conversation will either be anchored by least knowledgeable person or they will end up discussing something else.
