Hi, I'm Nitin, a software engineer and solutions architect. While my experience is heavily in financial technology, I am involved with projects in various sectors including clean energy, health and education.

### This Blog

I believe ventures succeed or fail on the tedious and unsexy details that often get overlooked or mismanaged. This blog provides examples and guidance on how to handle these better.

Other posts will cover things I'm working on including engineering, architecture, personal finance and economics.

### Advice and Consulting

I offer advice and consulting in an informal CTO capacity:
- Product, team and strategy sessions with founders and executives
- Requirements gathering sessions with clients and stakeholders
- Technical whiteboard sessions with engineering teams
- Interviewing candidates for new roles
- Open-source and vendor technology reviews, comparison and selection
- Project management and implementation of agile methodology
- Feedback and editing on technical, policy and procedural documentation
- Building proof of concepts

Currently only accepting new clients and business referrals via word-of-mouth.
