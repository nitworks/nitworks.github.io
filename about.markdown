"Nitworks" is a pun on my name, networks and artworks. 

I am not a big dreamer. Rather, I believe ventures succeed or fail on tedious and unsexy details that get overlooked or mismanaged. I'm here to help shine a light on them and suggest ways to move forward.

I offer consulting in an informal CTO capacity:
- Product, team and strategy sessions with founders, executives and VCs
- Requirements gathering sessions with clients and stakeholders
- Technical whiteboard sessions with engineering teams
- Feedback and editing on technical documentation (whitepapers, development journals, risk management policies, support procedures etc.)

Currently only accepting new clients via word-of-mouth.
